<h1>Intro üöÄ</h1>

<p>The purpose of this project is purely for my learning of the Java SWING toolkit, which was later superseded by Java FX. Here you will find a simple currency converter that leverages an external API to grab current converion rates. You will need internet access because it is talking to an external API everytime you press "Convert."</p>

<h2>‚öôÔ∏è How to install [For end users]: </h2>
<p>If you are not a developer and you do not have programming knowledge, then simply download the JAR file and run it on your machine.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Head over to the repository: https://github.com/YabiSkywalker/CurrencyConverter </li>
  <li>Click on the fourth file down called "CurrencyConverter.jar".</li>
  <li>Download the raw file to your machine, and double click to run it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>MacOS users: </h3>
<p>If you are using MacOS, you will likely experience an error right off the bat stating: "CurrencyConverter.jar‚Äù cannot be opened because it is from an unidentified developer. macOS cannot verify that this app is free from malware."</p>
<h4>Resolution: </h3>
<p>You need to open up settings, and authorize the install of the package you just downloaded.</p>
